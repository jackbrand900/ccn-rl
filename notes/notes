Right now, we have the ability to run the CCN+ shield either as a layer
or as a post-hoc shield

What configs do we need to specify to run in different configurations?

-Training
    - Train with post-hoc shielding
    - Train with integrated shielding
    - Train with no shielding
    - Train with progressive shielding
    - Shield can be either hard or soft

-Evaluation
    - Evaluate post-hoc shielding
    - Evaluate integrated shielding
    - Evaluate no shielding
    - Evaluate progressive shielding
    - Shield can be either hard or soft
